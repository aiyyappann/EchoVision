# EchoVision üé§üìö

**Enhancing Accessibility for the Visually Impaired through Audio and Braille Summaries**

---

## üìñ Overview

The **EchoVision** project helps visually impaired individuals by converting text-based documents into concise, portable audio summaries. It also provides Braille PDFs of these summaries, which can be printed using Braille printers. This system uses a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Text Extraction** with **pdfplumber**
2. **Summarization** with **AWS Bedrock's LLaMA model**
3. **Audio Conversion and Braille PDF Generation** using **Amazon Polly**

The downloadable audio and Braille outputs offer a flexible and engaging way to consume content on the go, enhancing accessibility and independence.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Input and Parsing

The system accepts PDF documents and extracts text efficiently using **pdfplumber**.

- **Input Format Handling:** Supports various text-based PDF files.
- **Text Extraction:** Uses pdfplumber to accurately capture document content.
- **Preprocessing:** Involves text cleaning, normalization, and segmentation for effective summarization.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Summarization

The preprocessed text is fed into **AWS Bedrock‚Äôs LLaMA model** to generate clear and concise summaries.

- **Model Selection:** AWS LLaMA model optimized for text summarization.
- **Summarization Process:** Formats the text to generate precise summaries that retain key insights.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Audio Conversion and Braille PDF Generation

**Amazon Polly** is used to convert the summarized text into natural-sounding speech, while Braille PDFs are generated for printing with Braille printers.

- **Audio Generation:** Produces high-quality MP3 audio compatible across devices.
- **Audio Enhancement:** Includes volume normalization and trimming for improved listening.
- **Downloadable Outputs:** Users can download both the MP3 audio and Braille PDFs for offline use.
